# Particles

Particles is a processing sketch simulating particle system interactions

The sketch can be played using the Processing IDE to open particles.pde in sketch>particles, or in the browser by opening index.html. To run locally, index.html must be on a local host to avoid the same-origin violation (i.e - http://localhost/particles/index.html).
